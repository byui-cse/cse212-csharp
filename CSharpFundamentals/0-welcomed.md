Dear Students,

Welcome to our course! This course is designed to deepen your understanding of fundamental data structures, such as stacks, sets, and trees. Throughout this journey, we will explore how these structures work, their applications, and how to implement them in various programming scenarios. Below, you will find links to modules that cover stacks, sets, and trees in detail.

If you have any questions or need assistance, please feel free to reach out to me.
