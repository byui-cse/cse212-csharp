# W13 Prove: Final Project - Peer Review
## Instructions
During class you will be placed into groups to perform a peer review of your playlist program. In the same way we review code, software engineers also review documentation including requirements, design, test cases, and user guides. Use the following checklist to guide your review:

* Read through [Final Project Description](../lesson11/prepare-alt) to make sure you got everything.
* Are the tests running and showing that the playlist is working properly?
* Are the performance tests showing expected performance for the data structures?
* Is the report all written within the `report.md` file? 
* Are there any problems with the Markdown formatting (e.g. links, pictures, tables, bullets)?
* Identify the best part of the peer's project.
* Identify the one part of the peer's project that could be improved.

At the end of class, write your name on the attendance sheet at the front of the classroom to get credit for the review activity. You should implement the feedback from your peers to improve your project before final submission next week.
