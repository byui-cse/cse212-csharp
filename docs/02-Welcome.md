introduction

Welcome to CSE 212: Programming with Data Structures! I'm James Leenue Kennedy, your instructor for this course. This class is designed to help you develop a solid understanding of
various data structures and their applications, which are crucial for efficient programming and problem-solving in computer science. You will learn about Big O Notation,
maps, linked lists, and more, gaining the skills needed to analyze and optimize algorithms effectively.

Below are links to three essential modules we will be covering in this course:

Big O Notation

Big O Notation Module
This module introduces you to the concept of Big O Notation, a mathematical notation used to describe the efficiency of algorithms. 
You will learn how to analyze the time and space complexity of various algorithms, helping you make informed decisions about
which data structures and algorithms to use in different situations.
Maps

Maps Module
In this module, you will explore maps (also known as dictionaries or hash tables). You will learn how maps store key-value pairs, allowing for
efficient data retrieval, insertion, and deletion. Understanding maps is essential for solving many real-world problems that involve associative arrays or lookups.
Linked Lists

Linked Lists Module
This module covers linked lists, a fundamental data structure consisting of nodes that together represent a sequence. You will learn about
different types of linked lists, such as singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. Mastering linked lists will
provide you with a strong foundation for understanding more complex data structures.
If you have any questions or need assistance throughout the course, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.
